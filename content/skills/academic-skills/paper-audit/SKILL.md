# Paper Audit Skill v3.0

Unified academic paper auditing across formats (LaTeX, Typst, PDF) and languages (English, Chinese). Runs automated checks, computes dimension scores, and optionally dispatches multi-perspective review agents.

---

## Capability Summary

- Run automated paper checks across `.tex`, `.typ`, and `.pdf` inputs.
- Produce self-check, peer-review, gate, polish, and re-audit outputs with explicit severity and priority labels.
- Combine script findings, venue-specific checklist items, and optional agent synthesis into one report flow.
- Reuse sibling writing-skill scripts for LaTeX and Typst inputs instead of re-implementing duplicate checks.

## Triggering

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- run a pre-submission readiness audit
- simulate a reviewer-style critique
- make a pass/fail submission gate decision
- compare a revised paper against a previous audit
- audit a PDF when the source format is unavailable

Trigger it even when the user only says “check my paper”, “review this submission”, “is this ready to submit?”, or “re-audit against the old report”.

## Do Not Use

- fixing the paper source as the first step when the project still fails to compile badly
- full literature research or survey drafting
- writing a paper from scratch
- template-specific LaTeX or Typst editing when the user wants direct source surgery instead of an audit report

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** modify `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, math environments, or any content listed in `$SKILL_DIR/references/FORBIDDEN_TERMS.md`
- **NEVER** fabricate bibliography entries; only verify existing `.bib` or `.yml` files
- **NEVER** change domain terminology without explicit user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** distinguish `[Script]` (automated) findings from `[LLM]` (agent judgment) assessments in output
- All dimension scores from scripts are **indicators**, not definitive judgments

## Mode Selection Guide

| Mode | When to Use | Output | Speed |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `self-check` | Pre-submission readiness check | Scores + issues + checklist | ~30s |
| `review` | Simulate multi-perspective peer review | Agent review reports + synthesis + revision roadmap | ~2min |
| `gate` | CI/CD quality gate, binary pass/fail | PASS/FAIL verdict + blocking issues | ~15s |
| `polish` | Expression refinement via agents | Precheck JSON + Critic/Mentor agent dispatch | ~1min+ |
| `re-audit` | Verify revisions against prior report | Verification checklist + new issues + score delta | ~1min |

### Mode Selection Logic

```
"Check my paper"                         -> self-check
"Review my paper" / "peer review"        -> review
"Is this ready to submit?"               -> gate
"Polish the writing"                     -> polish
"Did I fix the issues?" / "re-check"     -> re-audit
```

---

## Steps

### All Modes (Common)

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for file path and mode. If missing, ask the user for the target `.tex`, `.typ`, or `.pdf` file.
2. Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/REVIEW_CRITERIA.md` for scoring framework.
3. Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/CHECKLIST.md` for universal + venue-specific checklist items.
4. Run the orchestrator: `uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" $ARGUMENTS`.
5. Present the Markdown report directly to the user.

### Self-Check Mode

6. Review scores and highlight any Critical/P0 issues that block submission.
7. If `--scholar-eval` is present, read `$SKILL_DIR/references/SCHOLAR_EVAL_GUIDE.md` and formulate LLM assessments for Novelty, Significance, Ethics, and Reproducibility. Provide as `--llm-json` on a second run.

### Review Mode (Multi-Perspective)

6. Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/SCHOLAR_EVAL_GUIDE.md` for LLM assessment dimensions.
7. Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/quality_rubrics.md` for scoring anchors and decision mapping.
8. **Phase 0** (automated): The script output provides automated findings and scores.
   - When `--literature-search` is enabled, Phase 0 also includes literature search results and grounding score.
9. **Phase 1** (agents): For each agent in `$SKILL_DIR/agents/`:
   - Read the agent definition file for persona and protocol.
   - Dispatch a `Task` with: agent definition + paper content + Phase 0 results as context.
   - Agents: `methodology_reviewer_agent.md`, `domain_reviewer_agent.md`, `critical_reviewer_agent.md`.
   - When `--literature-search` is enabled, also dispatch `literature_reviewer_agent.md` (optional).
10. **Phase 2** (synthesis): Read `$SKILL_DIR/agents/synthesis_agent.md` and dispatch a `Task` to consolidate all reviews.
    - Input: Phase 0 automated results + Phase 1 agent reviews.
    - Output: Consensus classification, merged scores, final review report, revision roadmap.
11. Read `$SKILL_DIR/templates/review_report_template.md` for output structure.
12. Present synthesized report following the template format.

### Gate Mode

6. Report PASS or FAIL based on: zero Critical issues AND all checklist items pass.
7. List blocking issues (Critical only) and failed checklist items.

### Polish Mode

6. Read `.polish-state/precheck.json` generated by the script.
7. If blockers detected, report them and ask user to resolve before polishing.
8. Read `$SKILL_DIR/references/POLISH_GUIDE.md` for style targets and critic protocol.
9. Spawn nested tasks for the Critic Agent and Mentor Agents as defined in the polish workflow.

### Re-Audit Mode

6. Requires `--previous-report PATH` pointing to a prior audit report.
7. Script runs fresh checks and compares against previous findings.
8. Present verification checklist: each prior issue classified as `FULLY_ADDRESSED` / `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED` / `NOT_ADDRESSED`.
9. Report any `NEW` issues introduced during revision.
10. Show score comparison (before vs after).

## Required Inputs

- A target `.tex`, `.typ`, or `.pdf` file.
- An audit mode, or enough intent to infer one from the mode-selection guide.
- Optional venue or journal context when the checklist should be venue-specific.
- Optional `--previous-report PATH` for `re-audit`.

If the user omits the mode, infer it using the selection guide and state the assumption before running the audit.

## Output Contract

- Always return a report, not raw script output.
- Keep `[Script]` and `[LLM]` findings visibly separated.
- Include the selected mode, target file, and venue context near the top of the report.
- For blocking failures, list the exact blocking issue(s) and failed checklist items first.
- When a script or nested agent step fails, report the command, exit code, and what coverage was skipped.
- Preserve the source; this skill audits and synthesizes, it does not rewrite the paper by default.

## Venue-Specific Behavior

When `--venue` (or `--journal`) is specified, the audit adds venue-specific checks:

| Venue | Key Rules |
|-------|-----------|
| `neurips` | 9-page limit, broader impact statement, paper checklist, double-blind |
| `iclr` | 10-page limit, reproducibility statement, double-blind |
| `icml` | 8-page limit, impact statement, 50MB supplementary limit |
| `ieee` | Abstract <=250 words, 3-5 keywords, >=300 DPI figures |
| `acm` | CCS concepts required, acmart class, rights management |
| `thesis-zh` | GB/T 7714-2015 bibliography, bilingual abstract, university template |

Without `--venue`, only universal checklist items apply.

## Output Protocol

### Issue Format
```
[Severity: Critical|Major|Minor] [Priority: P0|P1|P2]: message (Line N)
```

### Severity Definitions
| Severity | Impact | Score Deduction (4-dim) |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Critical | Blocks submission | -1.5 per issue |
| Major | Significant quality concern | -0.75 per issue |
| Minor | Style/formatting improvement | -0.25 per issue |

### Source Labeling
- `[Script]` — Automated check result (objective, reproducible)
- `[LLM]` — Agent/LLM judgment (subjective, evidence-based)

---

## Scoring Systems

### 4-Dimension Score (1.0-6.0, base 6.0 with deductions)
| Dimension | Weight | Primary Checks |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Quality | 30% | logic, bib, gbt7714 |
| Clarity | 30% | format, grammar, sentences, consistency, references, visual, figures |
| Significance | 20% | logic, checklist |
| Originality | 20% | deai, checklist |

### 8-Dimension ScholarEval (1.0-10.0, optional via `--scholar-eval`)

> **v3.0**: Now supports 9 dimensions with Literature Grounding. Use `--literature-search` for automated literature verification.

| Dimension | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Soundness | 18% | Script |
| Clarity | 13% | Script |
| Presentation | 8% | Script |
| Novelty | 13% | LLM |
| Significance | 13% | LLM |
| Reproducibility | 8% | Mixed |
| Ethics | 5% | LLM |
| Literature Grounding | 12% | Mixed (NEW) |
| Overall | 10% | Computed |

See `$SKILL_DIR/references/quality_rubrics.md` for score-level descriptors and decision mapping.

## Integration with Sibling Skills

Paper-audit reuses check scripts from sibling skills via format-based routing:

| Format | Script Source | Checks Available |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `.tex` (English) | `latex-paper-en/scripts/` | format, grammar, logic, sentences, deai, bib, figures |
| `.tex` (Chinese) | `latex-thesis-zh/scripts/` (primary), `latex-paper-en/scripts/` (fallback) | + consistency, gbt7714 |
| `.typ` | `typst-paper/scripts/` | format, grammar, logic, sentences, deai |
| `.pdf` | `paper-audit/scripts/` only | visual, pdf_parser (no format/bib/figures checks) |

Scripts that live in paper-audit itself: `audit.py`, `check_references.py`, `visual_check.py`, `pdf_parser.py`, `detect_language.py`, `parsers.py`, `report_generator.py`, `scholar_eval.py`, `literature_search.py`, `literature_compare.py`, `scoring_model.py`.

---

## Literature Search Integration (NEW in v3.0)

When `--literature-search` is enabled, the audit pipeline adds external literature verification:

### How It Works

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts title, abstract, keywords, and method names from the paper.
2. **Query Generation**: Generates 5 search strategies (title-based, method-based, problem-based, keyword combos, negation-aware).
3. **Multi-Source Search**: Queries Semantic Scholar, arXiv, and optionally Tavily in parallel.
4. **Relevance Filtering**: Deduplicates and filters results by relevance to the paper (TF-IDF word overlap).
5. **Literature Comparison**: Compares found literature against the paper's bibliography.
6. **Grounding Score**: Computes a Literature Grounding score (1-10) based on coverage, recency, missing refs, and freshness.

### API Keys

| Source | Key | Required? |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Semantic Scholar | `--s2-key` or `S2_API_KEY` env var | Optional (works without key at lower rate limit) |
| arXiv | None | Free, no key needed |
| Tavily | `--tavily-key` or `TAVILY_API_KEY` env var | Required for Tavily source |

### Regression Scoring Model

When `--regression` is enabled with `--scholar-eval`, uses a Ridge regression model instead of weighted average for the overall score prediction. The model considers:
- 9 base dimension scores
- 3 interaction terms (soundness×novelty, clarity×significance, literature_grounding×novelty)
- 2 meta features (critical issue count, dimensions below 5.0)

Default model coefficients approximate the weighted-average behavior. Custom trained models can be placed at `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/models/scoring_model.json`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No file path provided | Ask user for a valid `.tex`, `.typ`, or `.pdf` file |
| Script execution fails | Report the command, exit code, and stderr output |
| Missing sibling skill scripts | Check that `latex-paper-en/scripts/`, `latex-thesis-zh/scripts/`, or `typst-paper/scripts/` exist |
| PDF checks limited | PDF mode skips format/bib/figures checks; only visual and content analysis available |
| `--venue` not recognized | Use one of: `neurips`, `iclr`, `icml`, `ieee`, `acm`, `thesis-zh` |
| ScholarEval LLM dimensions show N/A | Run with `--scholar-eval`, then provide LLM scores via `--llm-json` |
| Re-audit missing previous report | Provide `--previous-report PATH` pointing to the prior audit output |
| Literature search returns no results | Check API keys; Semantic Scholar works without key but slower; arXiv always available |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` not set | Set env var or pass `--tavily-key`; Tavily is optional — S2 + arXiv work without it |
| Semantic Scholar rate limited | Set `S2_API_KEY` for higher limits; the client has built-in exponential backoff |
| Literature Grounding shows N/A | Run with `--literature-search` to enable automated literature verification |
| Regression model gives unexpected scores | Check `scripts/models/scoring_model.json`; default coefficients approximate weighted average |
